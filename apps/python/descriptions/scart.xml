			<synopsis>
			scart [options] {archive-dir}
			</synopsis>
			<description>
			The last option has to be the archive directory when dump mode is enabled.
			When no archive directory is explicitly given,
			$SEISCOMP_ROOT/var/lib/archive or the current directory
			is used depending on whether $SEISCOMP_ROOT has been set or not.
			The default operation mode is import. That means that a multiplexed
			MiniSEED file or another record source such as ArcLink is used to import
			records into a SDS structure.

					<description>
					Check mode. Check all files

				<option flag="d" long-flag="dump">
					<description>
					Set export (dump) mode. Records are retrieved from an archive and
					written to standard output.

				<option flag="I">
					<description>
					Import mode: Specify the recordstream URL when in import mode.
					When using another recordstream than a file (like ArcLink) a stream

					<description>
					Uses a stream list file instead of defined networks and channels
					(-n and -c are ignored). The list can be generated from events
					by scevetstreams. One line per stream.
					Line format: starttime;endtime;streamID.
					The time format is the same as described in option '-t'.

					Example:

				<option flag="" long-flag="nslc" argument="file">
					<description>
					Uses a stream list file instead of defined networks and
					channels (-n and -c are ignored). In dump mode only. The
					time window must be provided separately. Wild cards may be
					used. The list can be generated from bindings by scdumpcfg
					or from inventory by scinv. Use one line per stream. Line
					format: NET.STA.LOC.CHA.

					Example:

					GR.CLL..BH?

					<description>
					Data stream selection as a comma separated list "stream1,stream2,streamX"

				</option>
				<option long-flag="speed">
					<description>
					Dump mode: specify the speed to dump the records. A value of 0 means
					no delay otherwise speed is a multiplier of the real time difference
					between the records. When feeding the records directly into the replay
					pipe a value of 1 (real time) is recommended.

				<option long-flag="stdout">
					<description>
					Import mode: write to stdout instead of creating a SDS archive.
					</description>

				<option long-flag="print-streams">

					and check mode. Output: NET.STA.LOC.CHA StartTime EndTime.

					Rename stream data according to the provided rule(s).
					A rule is "[match-stream:]rename-stream" and match-stream
