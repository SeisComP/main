			<synopsis>
			scart [options] {archive-dir}
			</synopsis>
			<description>
			The last option has to be the archive directory when dump mode is enabled.
			When no archive directory is explicitly given,
			$SEISCOMP_ROOT/var/lib/archive or the current directory
			is used depending on whether $SEISCOMP_ROOT has been set or not.
			The default operation mode is import. That means that a multiplexed
			MiniSEED file or another record source such as ArcLink is used to import
			records into a SDS structure.

					<description>
					Check mode. Check all files

					The time format is the same as described in option '-t'.
