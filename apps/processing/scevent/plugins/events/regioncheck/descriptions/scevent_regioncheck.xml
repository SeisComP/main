				Test if events lie within or outside geographic regions defined
				by polygons.
				Events within a region are flagged as positive, outside as negative.
				The event type is set accordingly. Add the
				plugin &quot;evrc&quot; to the plugins parameter in the
				order of priority to make this feature available. Read the
				documentation of the RegionCheck for more details.

				<parameter name="setEventType" type="boolean" default="true">
					<description>
						Allow setting the event type.
						The type of events which have manual origins will
						not be changed unless configured explicitely by
						&quot;overwriteManual&quot;.
					</description>
				</parameter>
				<parameter name="overwriteEventType" type="boolean" default="true">
					<description>
						Allow overwriting existing event types. Disabling does not
						allow accounting for changes in source region.

				<parameter name="overwriteManual" type="boolean" default="false">
					<description>
						Allow setting the event type if the mode of the preferred
						origin is manual or if the event type was set manually.

				<parameter name="regions" type="list:string" default="!reject">
					<description>
					The list of closed polygon names defining regions for
					flagging event as positive or negative.
					A polygon name defines a positive region but names with
					prefix !  (exclamation mark) define negative regions.
					Evaluation is done in the order of the polygons. The last
					matching criteria applies and the event type is set
					accordingly.

					Default: If events are not positive or are negative regions
					the event type is set to &quot;outside of network
					interest&quot;. Default:
					&quot;!reject&quot;, use &quot;accecpt&quot; to overwrite
					the default.

					Examples:

					Events are flagged positive within the polygon
					&quot;germany&quot;:

					germany

					All events are flagged positive but events within the
					polygon &quot;quarries&quot; are negative:

					accept,!quarries

					Events within the polygon &quot;germany&quot; are flagged
					positive but all other events and events within the polygon
					&quot;quarries&quot; are negaitve:

					germany,!quarries

					All events are flagged positive but events within the
					polygon &quot;germany&quot; are negative and all events
					within the polygon &quot;saxony&quot; are positive:

					accept,!germany,saxony

				<parameter name="readEventTypeFromBNA" type="boolean" default="false">
					<description>
					Consider the event type, minDepth and maxDepth values from
					the polygons defined by GeoJSON or BNA files. Read the
					documentation of the RegionCheck plugin for the details.

					When eventType is defined in the polygons, the value
					supersedes values of 'eventTypePositive' and
					'eventTypeNegative'.
					If not set, 'eventTypePositive' and 'eventTypeNegative' are
					considered.

				</parameter>
				<parameter name="eventTypePositive" type="string" default="">
					<description>
						New type of an event which is flagged positive. Ignored
						if 'readEventTypeFromBNA' is active and the polygons
						define eventType.

						Empty: Do not set type.

				<parameter name="eventTypeNegative" type="string" default="&quot;outside of network interest&quot;">
					<description>
						New type of an event which is flagged negative. Ignored
						if 'readEventTypeFromBNA' is active and the polygons
						define eventType.

						Empty means default: &quot;outside of network interest&quot;
