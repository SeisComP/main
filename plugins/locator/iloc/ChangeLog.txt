ChangeLog
=========

sciLoc4.2 - 2024-02-15
======================
- RSTT3.2.1; bugfix release
- modifications in Makefiles to support latest gcc.
- modifications in Makefiles to address Apple silicon compile and link issues.


sciLoc4.1 - 2023-05-21
======================
- updated the default depth grid from the rebuilt ISC bulletin, 1964-2020.
- updated the station lists.
- modified Makefiles to support Apple M1 and M2 processors


sciLoc4.0 - 2021-10-10
======================
- Incorporated the RSTT3.2 model, TT predictions and path-dependent uncertainties.
- Harmonized auxdata directory with standalone iLoc distribution. The standalone
  iLoc and the SeisComp plugin sciLoc now read the same auxdata directory.
- Moved the RSTT model to the auxdata/RSTTmodels directory.
- Separated model-specific and phase-specific paramaters into
  Global1DModelPhaseList.txt and IASPEIPhaseMap.txt files.
- Local velocity model, LocalVmodel in iLocConfig struct now understood as a full pathname


sciLoc3.2 - 2021-08-01
======================
- Ellipticity corrections: instead of P and S, Pup and Sup is now used for Pg,
  Pb and Sg, Lg, Sb, respectively
- Incorrect indices were used in getting travel time table values for exact
  depth values when only residuals were calculated.


sciLoc3.1 - 2020-11-27
======================
- upgraded to RSTT3.1, an updated global upper mantle and crust tomography model.
- uses the RSTT path-dependent uncertainty (model and pick) estimates to construct
  the data covariance matrix and decide if a phase is to be used in the location.
- RSTT does not provide travel-time predictions for direct phases for sources
  below the crust. In that case sciLoc reverts to the default 1D (ak135 or iasp91)
  travel-time predictions in order to avoid losing picks from local networks.
- Disabled the feature of fixing the origin time if the number of phases was
  less than the number of model parameters as this led to horribly wrong locations.
